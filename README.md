# Vehicle Emissions Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes vehicle emissions data to identify key factors that contribute to emissions. The goal is to understand the impact of various vehicle features, such as engine size, fuel type, and efficiency, on emissions, and to use these insights for emissions prediction.

## Problem Statement
With rising concerns over air quality and environmental health, understanding and predicting vehicle emissions based on various vehicle features has become crucial. This project aims to analyze how specific vehicle characteristics—such as engine size, fuel type, weight, and efficiency ratings—affect emission levels. By building predictive models on vehicle feature data, this study seeks to:

- Provide insights into which features contribute the most to emissions.
- Offer actionable knowledge for automakers, policymakers, and consumers to make environmentally friendly decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project majorly contains the following vehicle attributes with other as well(refer to the dataset):

- **Engine Size**: The size of the vehicle’s engine.
- **Number of Cylinders**: The number of cylinders in the engine.
- **Fuel Consumption**: The fuel consumption rates, typically measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
- **Emissions**: The emission levels of the vehicle, measured in grams per kilometer.

The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure quality and readiness for analysis.

## Key Objectives
1. **Feature Analysis**: Identify the vehicle attributes that most significantly influence emissions.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict emissions based on vehicle features.
3. **Insights and Recommendations**: Derive actionable insights to reduce vehicle emissions and promote eco-friendly practices.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Select and preprocess relevant features for modeling.
3. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate predictive models such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
5. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of insights and predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive analysis of vehicle features influencing emissions.
- Accurate predictive models to estimate emissions based on vehicle attributes.
- Visualizations and insights to support decision-making for eco-friendly initiatives.
